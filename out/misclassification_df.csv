I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99,hop better clock face make alarm clock replacement display brightness dim much night accomplish taskthe display work well camera viewingit attractive device decent value,3,5

"All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.",fine spot exact one massive fail order turn repeat alarm morning pretty much talk thing usually want first wake bed partner definitely like yes manually swipe alarm face dismiss swipe rather touch screen half asleep difficult result set snooze half time even really try swipe dismiss ii manage swipe dismiss completely delete recur alarmthis especially annoy amazon could easily fix simply make touch screen turn alarm delete least make set decide whether touch screen recur alarm snooze turn clock year still havent add set clearly go happen may biggest product design screw amazon ever make,2,5

"Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.",cant use baby monitor purchase didnt realize read review alexa skill sync nest cam consider poor review fact simple fix surprise amazon hasnt upgrade software allow minutes view alert like get nest app,1,5
"It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .",good siri still positives great play music set alarm personally felt pay much product nearly half prime day literally day purchase im pretty disappoint might still return get money back,2,5

"Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they “updated the firmware” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I’m getting really frustrated with the glitching.",great device feature awesome interaction fantastic home automation work perfect link account correctly issue echo show send repair screen glitching less months old already issuesfirst repair send update firmware get device back nothing work update newest firmware work weeks later glitch start againi love show im get really frustrate glitching,1,5
"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.",buy product hop alexa would pretty well develop far enough along therefore expect responsive piece crap doesnt even know respond question amazon tell ask echo button manual see step device potential give big screen decent sound buck would never reccomend even spend feel like get short oh lastly device pretty useless without prime membership link personal account thing literally decorate bluetooth speaker go family account one get work minimal oh even prime membership music pass something thats extra month leave item subscription nightmare overprice decorate bluetooth speaker eye would give zero star could,1,5
"I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn't do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.

"This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.",th echo device st echo show seem huge potential really want like soon find quite limit bite disappoint end world use like use screenless echo little month screen start flicker mostly bottom screen quick look forums make understand pointless ask replacement people devices replace start flicker shortly amazon provide serious answer go quite time apparentlylong story short move hallway use expensive bulky voice activate light switch hue light like headline suggest meh,2,5
"Still need more AI built into it to interact better. It needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding / answer needs to be right. You can't keep stop Alexa and ask again and again. Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in.",still need ai build interact better need continue conversation sometimes find answer need right cant keep stop alexa ask also able access wikipedia dictionary many areas better fast accessneeds hear us better also able name instead call alexa echo price reduce bite value base update auto daily improve connectivity home equipment imrproved wellgood product good sound quality need ai build,3,5

"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting.",ill return nothing annoy hub cant turn need interfere hue bridge cant even install philips light unless unplug plenty review go depth issue bottom line suck hub doesnt support zwave zigbee fairness know advance one protocol support doesnt many function dedicate one whats point notice right away philips hue bridge support firmware upgrade light bulbs doesnt find rather interest,1,5

"I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I’m sure I’m just a small customer to them, but I’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere",return piece garbage soon possible lifetime amazon spend approach nearly im sure im small customer ive rarely disappoint hundreds thousands amazon purchasesi echo home automation buy echo plus specifically builtin hub along approximately zigbee light switch voice control subpar even work rarity often nothing could disappoint product strongly discourage invest amazonzigbee ecosystem value money expect work product need look elsewhere,1,5
This is the best Amazon speaker with Alexa in it.  But if you’re thinking it’s a good smart hub you’re wrong. Are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell Alexa to Turn them on and off. That’s it! You’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.,best amazon speaker alexa youre think good smart hub youre wrong connect smart light devices tell alexa turn thats youre better buy separate hubs control devices,3,5
